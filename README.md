# Personal Website
## Inspiration

I wanted to make a personal website that not only showed my skills and relevant projects, but expressed my personality. I had a lot of fun personally designing this website and I hope that anyone who looks at it will be able to get a better idea of who I am.

## Process

To begin, I created a mockup design on Canva. I linked the mockup below.

I then implemented the canva design the best that I could. I utilized Bootstrap and FontAwesome for many of the features.
